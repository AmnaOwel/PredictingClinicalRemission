### Predicting Clinical Remission using Bayesian Networks  

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the use of **Bayesian Networks** and **ensemble methods** for predicting clinical remission. The workflow includes **data cleaning, data preprocessing, handling missing values, up-sampling using SMOTENC, and Bayesian network modeling** based on both expert knowledge and structure learning. Finally, a **weighted ensemble voting classifier** is implemented to combine multiple models for improved prediction accuracy.
